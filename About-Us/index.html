        <h3>David White</h3>
        <p>About:
            Lives in Charlottesville, VA. He's a big fan of Python, functional JavaScript and creating REST APIs with Node and Express.
            Goals:
            To create the API server for user authentication, user registration, sleep tracking and mood tracking. The server uses a PostgreSQL database and Express routing to manage and persist data. The server uses role-based authorization to restrict admin-level data from regular users, and ensures that a user can only view their personal data. The project used Node JS, Express, bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens, knex, and PostgreSQL.</p>
